COM-BAT-System
==============

This is the source code for my solar-powered Air Pollution Detector and Weather Sensing unit. (Carbon Monoxide Monitor - Barometer, Altimeter and Temperature)

The COM-BAT System, a solar-powered air pollution detector and weather sensing device, is a all-in-one environmental sensing unit. I designed, built, and am currently maintaining the device; it utilizes an Arduino processing unit with integrated sensors for measuring Carbon Monoxide and Methane atmospheric parts-per-million, as well as temperature, altitude and barometric pressure sensors. 
It can to be charged either through a solar panel (0.2v-18.0v, 450nA-1A) or normal wall chargers (1.5v-16v, 100mA-1.4A). The solar mechanism was designed specifically to accept the widest range of amperages possible.
